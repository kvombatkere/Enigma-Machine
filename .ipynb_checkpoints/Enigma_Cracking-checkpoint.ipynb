    "### Cracking the Enigma Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstract\n",
    "The Enigma machine was used by the German military forces in World War 2 (WW2) to encrypt messages. It was designed by engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War 1. The Enigma machine is an electro-mechanical device that both Encrypts and Decrypts communication text. It was used within all channels of communication of the German military and several models were implemented over the course of the 1930's and 1940's to improve the cipher strength. The Enigma was eventually cracked by British cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park, a joint effort of mathematicians, engineers and crossword enthusiasts led by Alan Turing. This paper discusses a Python (simulation) implementation used to crack the Enigma Cipher. The machine was simulated based on all the real parameters and wiring of the Enigma, and code was written to build a bombe simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of Functionality\n",
    "In terms of an overview of the design, the machine takes a text string as an input, first processes it to remove spaces and special characters and then encrypts or decrypts each character of the string separately as per the Enigma Cipher (explained subsequently). The Enigma machine outputs a string of letters, where each letter has been encrypted (or decrypted). This can be summarized with the following equation, for an input string $X = [x_1,x_2,...,x_n]$, the Enigma Machine returns an output string $Y = [y_1,y_2,...,y_n]$, where each input $x_i$ character is manipulated in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_i\\rightarrow Enigma(x_i)\\rightarrow y_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $Enigma(x_i)$, the encryption (or decryption) function is dependent on $i$ since it changes for every letter in the string as per the functionality of the Enigma machine. The machine was originally designed using the following electro-mechanical components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plugboard:** The plugboard was designed to swap pairs of letters that were input into subsequent stages of the Enigma. The plugboard enables a certain number of swapped letters and can be re-programmed as per the key. For example for a particular plugboard configuration the following pairs of letters might be swapped: $[P,E],[C,K],[T,X],[U,F],[R,L],[Y,H]$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rotors:** The Enigma consisted of a set of 8 rotors, of which any 3 could be used (placed in any position). Each of the rotors essentially implement a simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher, determined by the position of the rotor. In terms of their functionality, the rotors functioned in a cascaded manner, implementing a series of monoalphabetic substitutions as per their relative alignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reflector:** The reflector is the last core component of the Enigma, that is responsible for the symmetric Encryption and Decryption of a letter, given the same key. It ensures that the path of each letter through the entire machine is mapped uniquely to the path of one other letter, forming 13 unique pairings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the core code for the Enigma Machine has been reused from the previous assignment. The basic rotor functionality and Enigma instantiation was reused to allow for efficient checking of potential test rotor settings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Known-Plaintext Attack Methodology\n",
    "Provided with a text of length approximately 1000 characters and a 50 character crib of plaintext and corresponding cipher text, the goal was to use the the plaintext crib to work out the key settings and then work back from there to decrypt the rest of the cipher text. The following methodology was used:\n",
    "1. First a function findRotorPos(crib, ptext), was written, which takes as its inputs the 50 character crib and plaintext. For a particular set of input rotors (1, 2 and 3) as specified by the user, each one of the 17576 initial possible rotor settings is tested with the entire crib and plaintext.\n",
    "2. To achieve this the Enigma Machine was instantiated with each of the 17576 initial rotor settings, using no Plugboard swaps and the reflector B.\n",
    "3. Since the plugboard swaps account for some amount of deviation from the correct answer, a matchRate variable was created to keep track of the number of matches found between the crib and plaintext in this known-plaintext attack. Assuming there are 6 plugboard swaps, several letters would still mismatch, but the assuming some still match, 30% (15 out of 50) characters should still match up, since it is highly unlikely that these characters would match otherwise.\n",
    "4. All initial rotor setting values that yielded a match rate of higher than 30% were recorded, considerably reducing the search space. Once the initial rotor setting was identified, the Plugboard swaps were checked manually (dictionary approach could have been used too) and the cipher was cracked\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Decryption\n",
    "Once the initial rotor settings were figured out, a simple back calculation by subtracting the number of turns needed to get the particular point in the cipher text was done. This was subtracted from the rotor's initial position and then the rotor settings were figured out for the starting position of the cipher text, thus enabling complete decryption (since the plugboard swaps remain the same and have already been figured out by this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encrypted text files from the enigma drive folder were checked and successfully cracked using this crib-based known-plaintext attack. Details of the code and output tests are appended below, in addition to the new functions which were written to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "A working Python implementation of the bombe simulator for Enigma Machine was successfully achieved using the methodology outlined in this paper. Several test runs were done using the available encrypted texts and the plain texts were cracked\n",
    "All commented code is attached and output test runs are attached. "
