### Enigma-Machine
#### An object-oriented implementation of the Enigma Machine in Python, with full encryption and decryption functionality.

### Framework Overview
Enigma Machine functionality is implemented in the following modules:
1. ```Plugboard.py```, ```Rotorset.py``` and ```Reflector.py```- Implement the core components of the Enigma machine, as designed for use in WWII
2. ```Enigma.py``` - This module uses the other modules to initialize the Enigma, with full encryption and decryption functionality
3. ```Enigma_findRotorPos.py``` - Code to implement a known-plaintext attack methodology to crack the Enigma cipher
