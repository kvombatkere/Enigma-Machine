    "### German Enigma Machine Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Abstract\n",
    "The Enigma machine was used by the German military forces in World War 2 (WW2) to encrypt messages. It was designed by engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War 1. The Enigma machine is an electro-mechanical device that both Encrypts and Decrypts communication text. It was used within all channels of communication of the German military and several models were implemented over the course of the 1930's and 1940's to improve the cipher strength. The Enigma was eventually cracked by British cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park, a joint effort of mathematicians, engineers and crossword enthusiasts led by Alan Turing. This paper discusses a Python (simulation) implementation of the Enigma Machine. The machine was simulated based on all the real parameters and wiring of the Enigma, and code was written to build a design of the rotors, plugboard, and reflector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of Functionality\n",
    "Discussed below is theory and method used to build the German Enigma Machine. The simulator was implemented using Python and classes were written to specify the object structure of each individual component. The implementation was as per the original Enigma wirings, and the simulator was designed to be initialized and reprogrammed with different keys. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of an overview of the design, the machine takes a text string as an input, first processes it to remove spaces and special characters and then encrypts or decrypts each character of the string separately as per the Enigma Cipher (explained subsequently). The Enigma machine outputs a string of letters, where each letter has been encrypted (or decrypted). This can be summarized with the following equation, for an input string $X = [x_1,x_2,...,x_n]$, the Enigma Machine returns an output string $Y = [y_1,y_2,...,y_n]$, where each input $x_i$ character is manipulated in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_i\\rightarrow Enigma(x_i)\\rightarrow y_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $Enigma(x_i)$, the encryption (or decryption) function is dependent on $i$ since it changes for every letter in the string as per the functionality of the Enigma machine. The machine was originally designed using the following electro-mechanical components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plugboard:** The plugboard was designed to swap pairs of letters that were input into subsequent stages of the Enigma. The plugboard enables a certain number of swapped letters and can be re-programmed as per the key. For example for a particular plugboard configuration the following pairs of letters might be swapped: $[P,E],[C,K],[T,X],[U,F],[R,L],[Y,H]$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rotors:** The Enigma consisted of a set of 8 rotors, of which any 3 could be used (placed in any position). Each of the rotors essentially implement a simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher, determined by the position of the rotor. In terms of their functionality, the rotors functioned in a cascaded manner, implementing a series of monoalphabetic substitutions as per their relative alignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reflector:** The reflector is the last core component of the Enigma, that is responsible for the symmetric Encryption and Decryption of a letter, given the same key. It ensures that the path of each letter through the entire machine is mapped uniquely to the path of one other letter, forming 13 unique pairings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure illustrates the functionality of each component in the encryption (or decryption) of a letter using the Enigma Machine. It can be observed from the above figure that the $Enigma(x_i)$ function described earlier can be broken down in the following (informal) manner to understand the path of a single letter through the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Enigma(x_i) = [Plugboard \\rightarrow Rotor1 \\rightarrow Rotor2 \\rightarrow Rotor3 \\rightarrow Reflector \n",
    "\\rightarrow Rotor3 \\rightarrow Rotor2 \\rightarrow Rotor1 \\rightarrow Plugboard]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that every letter of the input text is encrypted by a different set of monoalphabetic substitutions specified by the rotating rotors of the Enigma. This makes the Enigma a very strong cipher (if used appropriately) with a massive key space of $\\approx 10^{16}$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building Components\n",
    "For the implementation of the Enigma, the following core methods and classes were written in Python, to specify the structure and functionality of the various components of the Enigma:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *genDictionary()* - This method was used to create an easy dictionary of the letters of the alphabet so as to access the index of a character in English efficiently in O(1) time. Note that the convention (a = 0, .., z = 25) was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Plugboard* - This class implements the Enigma's plugboard and enables the creation of a Plugboard object that can be reprogrammed with different pairs of letter swaps. It is initialized without any swaps at first, and then takes a 2D list of to-be-swapped characters as an input and implements the swaps within its structure. The plugboard class also implements functions to both forward and reverse swap letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Reflector* - This class specifies the structure of the Reflector in the Enigma. It sets an array of letters that describe the reflector and implements the reflection function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Rotor* - This class defined the attributes and functionality of a single rotor in the Enigma. It specifies the sequence of letters (as an array) that describe the monoalphabetic permutation of the rotor. Variables to keep track of the position of the rotor were implemented as well as function rotate it, using modulo 26 math. It also implements functions to forward and reverse substitute letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. *RotorSet* - This class specifies the structure of the set of objects comprising of 3 *Rotors* and the *Reflector*. It enables the assignment (and reassignment) of rotors to the *RotorSet* object and enables the repositioning of these rotors. A function to encrypt and decrypt text using a combination of the rotors and reflector was implemented. A rotateFlag boolean was used to control the odometer-like gear functionality of the rotors, so as to spin correctly after each letter is processed. Note that it inherits properties from the *Rotor* and *Reflector* classes\n",
    "\n",
    "6. *Enigma* - This class specifies the structure of the Enigma machine and implements the *RotorSet* and *Plugboard* objects within one larger *Enigma* object. It allows for the setting of a key to make it reprogrammable. Functions to display current settings of the various components were also implemented to enable easy verification and testing. The main text processing functionality of the Enigma was implemented within this class, to process an input string as per the Enigma Cipher and return an output string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specifying the Key\n",
    "The key for the Enigma Machine implementation used the following format to specify a unique key configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Key \\approx (rotors, rotorPos, ReflectorNum, PlugboardSwaps)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "-  In the above list of paramters, *rotors* is a list with 3 numbers and refers to the indices of the list of available rotors stored in a separate array Enigma_Rotors. Note that the convention used for this project was that Rotor1 is the fastest spinning rotor and is the one nearest to the Plugboard.\n",
    "-  *rotorPos* is a list with 3 numbers specifying the starting positions of the 3 rotors in the Enigma. Based on the specified positions, the rotors are rotated to the correct starting position\n",
    "-  *ReflectorNum* refers to the index of the list of available reflector stored in a separate array Enigma_Reflectors. \n",
    "-  *PlugboardSwaps* is a list of pairs of characters that shall be swapped by the plugboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encryption and Decryption\n",
    "Encryption and Decryption follow the exact same procedure on the Enigma Machine. For a particular character, $x_i$ in a string, the fundamental property, $Dec[Enc(x_i)] = x_i$ only holds when both the Encryption and Decryption key is the same for the Enigma. Thus it is crucial to ensure that initial key settings for the Enigma are exactly the same when encrypting and decyrpting text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "A working Python implementation of the Enigma Machine was successfully achieved. Several test runs were conducted to encrypt and decrypt strings of text, using a variety of initial key settings, and were checked to be correct.\n",
    "All commented code is attached. "

Although we tend to blame religion for condemning man to life as a sinner, the guilt that may once have attached to specific vices – vices for which religious communities could prescribe appropriate penance– now seems, in a more secular era, to surface in relation to just about anything: food, sex, money, work, unemployment, leisure, health, fitness, politics, family, friends, colleagues, strangers, entertainment, travel, the environment, you name it. As a teacher of critical theory, I know how crucial and revelatory its insights can be. But I’ve occasionally also suspected that our desire for systematic and structural forms of explanation may be fuelled by our anxiety at the prospect of discovering we’re on the wrong side of history.When wielded indelicately, explanatory theories can offer their adherents a foolproof system for knowing exactly what view to hold, with impunity, about pretty much everything – as if one could take out an insurance policy to be sure of always being right. Often, too, that’s as far as such criticism takes you – into a right-thinking that doesn’t necessarily organise itself into right-acting.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Text2 = \"On this basis, then, it may be possible to think of survivor’s guilt as a special case of the guilt we all bear when, aware or unaware, we’re glad when others, rather than ourselves, suffer. Obviously, that’s not a pleasant feeling, but neither is it a hard one to understand. Still, there remains something deeply uncomfortable about accepting that survivors of the worst atrocities should feel any guilt for their own survival. Instead, shouldn’t we be trying to save the survivor from her (in our view) mistaken feelings of guilt andthus establish, without smirch or quibble, her absolute innocence? This understandable impulse, according to the intellectual historian Ruth Leys, saw the figure of “the survivor” emerge in the period after the second world war, alongside a shift in focus from the victim’s feelings of guilt toward an insistence on the victim’s innocence. This transformation, Leys argues, involved replacing the concept of guilt with its close cousin, shame. The difference is crucial. The victim who feels guilt evidently has an inner life, with intentions and desires – while the victim who feels shame seems to have had it bestowed from outside. The victims of trauma consequently appear to be the objects rather than the subjects of history\"\n"

    "pt1 = \"Although cocitation and bibliographic coupling are mathematically similar measures they can in practice give noticeably different results. In particular, they are affected strongly by the number of ingoing and outgoing edges that vertices have. For two vertices to have strong cocitation—to be pointed to by many of the same other vertices—they must both have a lot of incoming edges in the first place. In a citation network, for instance, two papers can only have strong cocitation if they are both well cited and hence strong cocitation is limited to influential papers, review articles, books, and similar highly cited items. Conversely, two papers can only have strong bibliographic coupling if they both cite many others, i.e., if they have large bibliographies. In practice, the sizes of bibliographies vary less than the number of citations papers receive, and hence bibliographic coupling is a more uniform indicator of similarity between papers than cocitation. The Science Citation Index, for example, makes use of bibliographic coupling in its “Related Records” feature, which allows users to find papers similar to a given paper. Cocitation would be less appropriate in this situation, since it tends not to work well for papers with few citations.\"\n",
